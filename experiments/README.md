# Experiments

This directory contains Jupyter Notebook files used for various experiments.

## Files

1. **generate_frames.ipynb**: Script used to generate frames of solid colors and vary the least significant bits for each color.
2. **performance_test.ipynb**: Script used to test variations of implementations of the same code to identify the most efficient implementation.
3. **psnr.ipynb**: Script used to calculate the PSNR between the generated frames, aiming to estimate how different the original image is compared to the steganographic image.
